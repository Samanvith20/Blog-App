Blog App README
Introduction
This is a Blog App that allows users to explore and read various blog posts. The application consists of three main pages: Home, Contact, and About. Additionally, it provides the functionality to fetch and display detailed blog information by making API requests.

Features
Home Page: The Home page serves as the main landing page where users can see a list of available blog posts.

Contact Page: The Contact page provides contact information or a form for users to get in touch with the website's administrators.

About Page: The About page offers information about the website or the organization behind it.

Blog Details: Users can click on a blog post from the Home page to view more detailed information about the selected blog post, including the title, content, author, and associated images.

Technologies Used
React: The front-end of the application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

React Router: React Router is used for managing the application's routes and navigating between different pages.

API Integration: The app integrates with an external API to fetch and display detailed blog post information.

Styling: CSS and possibly a CSS preprocessor (e.g., Sass or Less) are used for styling the user interface.
